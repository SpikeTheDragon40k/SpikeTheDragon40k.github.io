      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;guardandomi-indietro-ogni-minuto-speso-√®-valso-davvero-la-pena&#34;&gt;Dopo tanto impegno e tante sfide affrontate, sono riuscito a raggiungere il 1¬∞ posto nella Diamond League su TryHackMe! üèÜüíé
√à stato un percorso lungo e pieno di ostacoli: ore e ore passate tra macchine da risolvere, notti a studiare, momenti difficili ma anche tante piccole soddisfazioni lungo la strada.
Un grazie sincero a TryHackMe per aver creato una piattaforma che rende davvero la cybersecurity concreta, stimolante e alla portata di tutti.
Durante questo cammino ho avuto anche il piacere di conquistare diverse vittorie nelle modalit√† King of the Hill e CTF, che mi hanno spinto ogni volta a mettermi in gioco sempre di pi√π.
üî• Questo risultato non √® solo l&amp;rsquo;inizio di qualcosa di nuovo, ma anche il punto d‚Äôarrivo di tanti sforzi che oggi sento ripagati.
Guardandomi indietro, ogni minuto speso √® valso davvero la pena.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm really happy to share that I‚Äôve reached 1st place in the Diamond League on TryHackMe! üèÜüíé
It‚Äôs been a long road, full of challenges ‚Äî late nights, tons of learning, solving tricky boxes, and pushing through tough moments.
A big thank you to TryHackMe for building such a great platform that makes learning cybersecurity not only hands-on and practical, but actually fun and accessible.
Along the way, I‚Äôve also had the chance to win several King of the Hill and CTF competitions, each one pushing me to go a little further and improve.
üî• This isn‚Äôt just the start of something new ‚Äî it also feels like a well-earned achievement after a lot of hard work.
Looking back, every minute spent was totally worth it

&lt;p&gt;Two critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities‚Äî&lt;strong&gt;CVE-2025-4427&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;CVE-2025-4428&lt;/strong&gt;‚Äîhave been discovered in &lt;strong&gt;Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM)&lt;/strong&gt;, formerly known as MobileIron Core. These flaws allow unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands on affected systems. Ivanti disclosed these vulnerabilities on May 14, 2025, with active exploitation in the wild reported shortly thereafter. The vulnerabilities stem from improper input validation, enabling attackers to bypass authentication and execute system-level commands. These vulnerabilities pose a severe risk to enterprises using Ivanti‚Äôs mobile device management platform.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, SonicWall has been under significant fire, facing a barrage of zero-day vulnerabilities‚Äîseveral of which have been actively exploited in the wild. These flaws primarily affect SonicWall‚Äôs SSLVPN and Secure Mobile Access (SMA) appliances, putting enterprise environments at serious risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post consolidates the most pressing vulnerabilities across SonicWall&amp;rsquo;s platforms, explains their implications, and outlines clear action steps for defenders. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re managing Gen7 firewalls or SMA 1000 devices, patching and mitigation efforts can no longer be postponed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The LockBit ransomware gang, one of the most prolific cybercriminal groups in recent years, has suffered a significant breach. Their dark web affiliate panels were defaced with the message ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do crime CRIME IS BAD xoxo from Prague,‚Äù linking to a MySQL database dump. This archive contains a SQL file from LockBit‚Äôs affiliate panel database that includes twenty tables, notably including a ‚Äòbtc_addresses‚Äô table with 59,975 unique bitcoin addresses and a ‚Äòchats‚Äô table containing over 4,400 victim negotiation messages from December 2024 to the end of April 2025. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volt Typhoon&lt;/strong&gt; is a sophisticated, state-sponsored Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group attributed to the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China (PRC). Active since at least mid-2021, the group focuses on cyber-espionage and pre-positioning within critical infrastructure sectors, primarily in the United States. Their operations are characterized by stealth, persistence, and the strategic use of &amp;ldquo;living-off-the-land&amp;rdquo; techniques to evade detection.(&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.txone.com/blog/volt-typhoon-and-supply-chain-vulnerabilities/?utm_source=chatgpt.com&#34; title=&#34;The Latent Storm: Volt Typhoon and Supply Chain Vulnerabilities&#34;&gt;TxOne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/volt-typhoon-threat-brief/?utm_source=chatgpt.com&#34; title=&#34;Threat Brief: Attacks on Critical Infrastructure Attributed to Insidious ...&#34;&gt;Unit 42&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt_Typhoon?utm_source=chatgpt.com&#34; title=&#34;Volt Typhoon&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>RealWorld: LockBit Strikes</title>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;realworld-lockbit-strikes&#34;&gt;RealWorld: LockBit Strikes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today‚Äôs cybersecurity landscape, ransomware attacks remain one of the most severe threats to businesses‚Äîespecially when executed in a coordinated and large-scale manner. A recent incident involved a major compromise affecting over &lt;strong&gt;5,000 endpoints across 7 corporate sites&lt;/strong&gt;, including &lt;strong&gt;5 production facilities&lt;/strong&gt;. The attack led to a &lt;strong&gt;complete halt in business operations&lt;/strong&gt;, highlighting the vulnerability of even seemingly robust infrastructures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-attack-dynamics&#34;&gt;The Attack Dynamics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attack has been attributed to the notorious ransomware group &lt;strong&gt;LockBit&lt;/strong&gt;, one of the most active and dangerous cyber gangs in recent years. The malware struck numerous systems simultaneously, encrypting data and rendering IT resources unusable. The production sites‚Äîcore to the company&amp;rsquo;s operations‚Äîwere taken completely offline, halting the supply chain and logistics with severe economic consequences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MFA Fatigue Attacks</title>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;-mfa-fatigue-attacks-when-multi-factor-becomes-a-multi-failure&#34;&gt;üîê MFA Fatigue Attacks: When Multi-Factor Becomes a Multi-Failure&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) was once hailed as the gold standard of secure authentication. But threat actors, always watching and adapting, have flipped the script. Enter &lt;em&gt;MFA fatigue attacks&lt;/em&gt; ‚Äî a low-tech but high-impact tactic that exploits the weakest link: human behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-the-psychology-behind-push-bombing&#34;&gt;üß† The Psychology Behind Push Bombing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of breaking cryptography or brute-forcing passwords, attackers are going after &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;. In a typical MFA push fatigue attack, a user is bombarded with a relentless stream of authentication requests. The goal? Wear them down until they finally hit ‚ÄúApprove‚Äù just to make it stop.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-0411&#34;&gt;CVE-2025-0411&lt;/a&gt; is a high-severity vulnerability identified in the widely used 7-Zip archiving tool. The flaw lies in how 7-Zip processes specially crafted &lt;code&gt;.7z&lt;/code&gt; files, which can lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service. Initially disclosed by Trend Micro‚Äôs Zero Day Initiative (ZDI-25-045), the vulnerability poses a serious threat due to 7-Zip&amp;rsquo;s extensive use across consumer and enterprise environments. While no active exploitation has been reported at the time of writing, the availability of public proof-of-concept code increases the likelihood of weaponization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;executive-summary&#34;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CVE-2024-30088 is a high-impact vulnerability recently leveraged by the hacking group APT34 (a.k.a. OilRig), a threat actor with ties to the Iranian government. This flaw allows privilege escalation within the Windows kernel, granting attackers administrative privileges on affected systems. The group has exploited this vulnerability to carry out espionage campaigns targeting government entities and critical infrastructure, especially in the Persian Gulf region and the United Arab Emirates. These attacks are part of a broader effort to establish persistent access and exfiltrate sensitive credentials by compromising Microsoft Exchange servers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
