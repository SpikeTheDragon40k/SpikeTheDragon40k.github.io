    Hi, I'm Adriano a passionate cybersecurity professional based in Verona, Italy, specializing in EDR/XDR platforms and threat hunting. With hands-on experience securing enterprise environments using tools like CrowdStrike Falcon, Sentinel One EDR, and Qualys, I've deployed defenses, led incident response, and hunted threats across complex infrastructures. By night, I tinker with Raspberry Pi home labs, tackle challenges on TryHackMe and Hack The Box, and contribute to open-source projects like TLDR Pages.

    I am most skilled in: <mark>CrowdStrike Falcon</mark> and <mark>Threat Hunting</mark> but also have experience with: <mark>Sentinel One EDR</mark>, <mark>Qualys Vulnerability Management</mark>, <mark>SIEM Solutions</mark> and <mark>Incident Response</mark>.

          sshman revolutionizes secure SSH management—encrypted vaults make key handling effortless for homelabs and enterprises.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          sshman is my open-source CLI tool for managing SSH keys and connections with encrypted .vssh vaults, key generation, and direct SSH support—perfect for threat hunters juggling multiple endpoints.
          Born from real-world SecOps needs, it streamlines secure access in homelabs (Raspberry Pi clusters) and production (CrowdStrike/Sophos fleets). 
          With 5 releases and growing stars, it's a portfolio highlight showcasing my bash scripting and crypto skills.
